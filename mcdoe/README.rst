==================
Provides simulation- and BioCCP-based approaches for computing the minimal plant library size 
that guarantees full combinatorial coverage (and other relevant statistics) for multiplex CRISPR/Cas experiments in plants.

The original codebase can be found on the [MultiplexCrisprDOE GitHub repo](https://github.com/kirstvh/MultiplexCrisprDOE) on which the scripts in the wrapper our based on, released under the MIT License.
