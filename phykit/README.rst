PhyKIT is a UNIX shell toolkit for processing and analyzing phylogenomic data.
PhyKIT helps process and analyze multiple sequence alignments and phylogenies.
Generally, all functions are designed to help understand the contents of alignments (e.g., gc content or the number of parsimony informative sites) and the shape of trees (e.g., treeness, degree of violation of a molecular clock).
